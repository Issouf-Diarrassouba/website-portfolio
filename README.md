# Issouf Diarrassouba — Portfolio Website


This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my background, projects, and interests in software engineering, backend systems, cloud infrastructure, as well as hands-on work and practical experience across the technology field.

The site is designed to be clean, responsive, and network-friendly, with an emphasis on clarity, usability, and thoughtful interaction rather than visual noise.
